# Building a WordPress Classic Theme with Pinegrow

Have you ever considered creating your own WordPress theme but found the process daunting? Maybe you‚Äôve used page builders in the past but are frustrated by the constant updates, patches, bugs, and limitations.

In this mini-course, we‚Äôll build a native WordPress theme from start to finish with no code using Pinegrow‚Äôs WordPress Builder. By the end of this course, you‚Äôll have a minimal WordPress theme that you can style, customize, reuse, and redistribute to your clients. With no page builder or other dependencies!

This course was previously on sale for $49, but I‚Äôm making it available for free. Why am I doing this? While Block Themes are the direction WordPress is pushing, Classic WordPress themes are still incredibly useful, and they aren‚Äôt going away anytime soon. With renewed community interest in making sustainable websites that don't depend on 3rd party pagebuilders, I thought the time was right to release this to the public.
